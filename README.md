# Baked
"Baked" application is built to provide an insight into a variety of strains of marijuana. It can be used by a user who has no prior knowledge about it. It also recommends the users about a strain which may be helpful to them as per their needs. The recommendation system is mostly useful to a new user who is not aware of the impact a given type of strain can cause. It also explains the effects of various strains with different forms of visualizations. One of the amazing features of the app is that it has map functionality which helps the user identify different stores which are selling a variety of strains. The app allows users to log in to their account using Gmail to set their preferences or use the app anonymously.

## Libraries

## Code Examples
You will encounter roadblocks and problems while developing your project. Share 2-3 'problems' that your team solved while developing your project. Write a few sentences that describe your solution and provide a code snippet/block that shows your solution. Example:

**Problem 1: We needed a method to calculate a Fibonacci sequence**

A short description.
```
// The method we implemented that solved our problem
public static int fibonacci(int fibIndex) {
    if (memoized.containsKey(fibIndex)) {
        return memoized.get(fibIndex);
    } else {
        int answer = fibonacci(fibIndex - 1) + fibonacci(fibIndex - 2);
        memoized.put(fibIndex, answer);
        return answer;
    }
}
